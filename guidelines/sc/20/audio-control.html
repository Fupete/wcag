   <h4>Audio Control</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p>If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, at least one of the following is true:</p>
   <dl>
     <dt>Pause or Stop</dt>
     <dd>A <a>mechanism</a> is available to pause or stop the audio.</dd>
     <dt>Volume Control</dt>
     <dd>A <a>mechanism</a> is available to control the audio volume, independently from any other audio output of the user agent and the overall system.</dd>
   </dl>
   
   <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether or not it is used
      to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference</a>.
   </p>

   <p class="note">A user agent's ability to disable auto-playing media and/or mute a specific sound source (independently from any other audio
      output, e.g. a browser allowing to mute the audio playing in a specific tab) are acceptable mechanisms to stop or control the volume of
   auto-playing audio content. However, not all user agents may have this capability.</p>
